# Description

In this challenge, there is a simple <select> menu with a list of books. When a book is selected, the app should fetch the book's details from the API and display them. We have already implemented a getData function â€“ your job is to create a query that fetches the book details based on the selected book.

## Tasks

1.Create a query that accepts a bookId parameter
2.When a book is selected, render the book's details
3.When a book is loading, render the <Loading /> component
4.If there is an error fetching the book, render the <Error /> component
