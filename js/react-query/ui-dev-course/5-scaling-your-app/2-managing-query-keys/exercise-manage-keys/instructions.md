In this challenge, our goal is to refactor our App to use a more structured approach for defining our `QueryKeys`. We'll create two factories, `bookQueries` and `reviewQueries`, that will help us to define our `QueryKeys` in a more consistent way. To accomplish this, you will be editing both `queries.js` and `mutations.js`.

Tasks

- Create a query factory for bookQueries with keys for all, detail, featured, myBooks, and search.
- Create and export a query factory for reviewQueries with keys for all, detail, and latest.
- Refactor all of the queries to use the new query factories.
- Refactor all of the mutations to use the new query factories.
