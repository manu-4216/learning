# ui.dev course

URL: https://ui.dev/c/query

### Intro

I completed ui.dev course on Typescript in the past, and had a great experience. The integrated exercises are particularly useful to practice the concepts.

For this reason, I also did this react query course as well, as it is created by the creators of react query themselves.

### Course process

I will transcribe here important code snippets from various chapters.
