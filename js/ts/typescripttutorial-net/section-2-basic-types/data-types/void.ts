// The void type denotes the absence of having any type at all.
// It is a little like the opposite of the any type

// Typically, you use the void type as the return type of functions that do not return a value. For example:
function log(message): void {
  console.log(message);
}

// It is a good practice to add the void type as the return type of a function or a method that doesnâ€™t return any value.
// By doing this, you can gain the following benefits:

// - Improve clarity of the code: you do not have to read the whole function body to see if it returns anything.
// - Ensure type-safe: you will never assign the function with the void return type to a variable
